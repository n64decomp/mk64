# Mario Kart 64   
This decompilation of Mario Kart 64 pursues historical and educational elements within the game found via taking it apart and putting it back together. Inspiration to do so not only emanates from the game's hardware and technology but also its immensely positive effects on the cultures and families of nearly every nationality.

This repository does not contain assets. Compiling requires asset extraction from a prior copy of the game.

It supports and builds the following versions:

| ROM Output      | Revision| SHA-1 Checksum                           |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| mk64.us.z64     | USA     | 579c48e211ae952530ffc8738709f078d5dd215e |
| mk64.eu.v10.z64 | EUR 1.0 | a729039453210b84f17019dda3f248d5888f7690 |
| mk64.eu.v11.z64 | EUR 1.1 | f6b5f519dd57ea59e9f013cc64816e9d273b2329 |

## Progress

[![Linux Compile](https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64/actions/workflows/linux-compile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64/actions/workflows/linux-compile.yml)

![Build Status](https://n64decomp.github.io/mk64/total_progress.svg)

## Quick Start

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
OR
git clone https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64 --recurse-submodules
```
Extract assets
```
make -C tools -j
make assets -j
make -j
```

## Building

Build instructions located in the [API docs](https://n64decomp.github.io/mk64/compiling.html)  
See also, the comprehensive API and documentation which includes an overview of the code-base while also discussing significant concepts, features, and modding.

## Current State

The code-base may change significanty overtime as naming and documentation continues.
Adjustments to the game require compiling with AVOID_UB=1 to enable shiftability. Use DEBUG=1 to enable the games debug mode.

Some menu textures are compressed using a format called tkmk00. A byte-matching compressor/decompressor does not yet exist.
