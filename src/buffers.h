 *   kart_palette contains the palette for all non-wheel elements of the kart (including the driver).
 *   wheel_palette contains the palette for the wheels.
 *
 * kart palette sets a defined palette based on the character while
 * wheels palette sets a dynamic palette as you drive around with the kart.
 *
 * The term "palette" appears to be synonymous with "texture lookup table (TLUT)",
 * at least as far as the N64 texture engine is concerned
 * According to http://ultra64.ca/files/documentation/online-manuals/man/app/te/us/tlf.html
 * palettes are technically arrays of u32's, but I feel using a more meaningful data type
 * helps with understanding.
